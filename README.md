# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction

The aim of the project is to predict the sales of Big Markets. The Big Market sales dataset also consists of certain attributes for each product and store. This model helps Big Market understand the properties of products and stores that play an important role in increasing their overall sales. We perform exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing and feature engineering on the dataset. The required outlets are shown as graphs in different ways and software used is jupyter notebook, libraries like numpy,pandas, seaborn,etc are imported. We compare, correlate and predict the behavior of the outlet columns.

# Problem Definition

Analysing the data , performing Exploratory Data Analysis and finding patterns and trends inside the data.
Regression is an important machine learning model for these kinds of problems. 
Predicting sales of a company needs sales and purchases being happened till date of that company.
Based on that data that fits in the model we can predict the sales of that company or product. 
So, in this research project we will analyze the sales, product information, location types, item mrp etc of a company and will predict the sales of the company for a specific product. 
For this kind of project of sales predict, we will apply the Random Forest regressor, decision tree, K-Means Clustering and evaluate the result based on the training and validation set of the data.
Using test dataset will predict sales of company data and identify their profits.
